# Reach Docs

This directory contains documentation for different aspects of Reach

Much of the documentation is in the form of markdown with embedded latex.
For rendered preview, vs code provides a nice view, as does stackedit.io.

* [overview](overview.md) contains an overview of 
the Reachability problem and Reach tool. Latex embedded [1].

* [slides](slides/present.pdf) contains a presentation on Reach focusing on proofs.
To build, run 'pdflatex present.tex' on a system with teTex or
similar.

* [uni](uni.md) contains some ideas about unified queueing to
alleviate the problems based on the 2-phase nature of the algorithms 
on which iic is based.  Latex embedded [1].
